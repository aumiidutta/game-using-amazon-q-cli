- Score cannot go below 0
- Game ends if score reaches 0 after hitting obstacles
- Hitting Black Hole or Planet Orbit: Instant game over
- Reaching Pluto: Win condition regardless of score

DIFFICULTY LEVELS:
=================

EASY:
- Slower obstacle movement
- Less frequent obstacle spawning
- More time to react

MEDIUM:
- Moderate obstacle movement speed
- Regular obstacle spawning rate
- Balanced challenge

HARD:
- Faster obstacle movement
- More frequent obstacle spawning
- Quick reflexes required

VISUAL FEEDBACK:
===============
- Game Over Message: Red text for losing, Green text for winning
- Real-time score updates
- Progress percentage to Pluto
- Current rocket position coordinates
- All obstacles clearly color-coded for easy identification

GAME PROGRESSION:
================
- Journey distance: 1000 units to Pluto
- Obstacles spawn randomly from the top
- Movement speed increases with difficulty
- Pluto appears when you're close to the destination (within 50 units)
- Game ends when you either:
  * Reach Pluto (WIN)
  * Hit a Black Hole (LOSE)
  * Enter wrong Planet Orbit (LOSE)
  * Score drops to 0 from obstacle hits (LOSE)

STRATEGY TIPS:
=============
- Watch the color coding - memorize which colors are dangerous
- Black (Black Hole) and Purple (Planet Orbit) = Instant death
- Pink (Pluto) = Your winning destination
- Plan your movements ahead - don't wait until obstacles are too close
- Balance risk vs. reward - sometimes it's better to take a small hit than risk a black hole
- Keep track of your score - don't let it reach zero
- Use the full width of the playing area for maneuvering
